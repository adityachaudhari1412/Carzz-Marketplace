# CARZZ 3330 App (Updated in 2024)

## Project History

This project was originally developed as part of my Bachelor's coursework in 2022. It was a full-stack vehicle marketplace platform built to practice React, Node.js, and database management.

In 2024, I revisited and updated the project to:
- Host it on a cloud server for public accessibility
- Update packages and dependencies to the latest versions
- Implement modern coding practices and security enhancements
- Ensure the app is production-ready with backend and frontend improvements

You can find the current version of this project here: [Carzz-Marketplace](https://github.com/adityachaudhari1412/Carzz-Marketplace.git).

## Getting Started

The UI project is built with **React** and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Backend Setup

The backend **Node.js** server was initialized using `npm init`. All relevant dependencies are listed in `package.json`.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server for the UI, run:

To ensure continuous running, we use **nodemon** to automatically restart the server after crashes. Run the following:


### Database

A backup of the database schema can be found in the file `carzz3330.sql` located in the project repository. The application uses a MySQL database for managing vehicle listings, users, and transactions.

## Updates Made in 2024

- **Cloud Hosting**: Configured the app to run on a public cloud server.
- **Package Updates**: Updated all dependencies and packages to ensure compatibility with modern versions.
- **Security Enhancements**: Removed sensitive data and integrated environment variables for database credentials and API keys.
- **Code Refactoring**: Applied modern JavaScript and React best practices to improve code efficiency and maintainability.
